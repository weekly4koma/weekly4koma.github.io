				A new weekly exercise/challenge for all anons of all levels. <br><br>

				Since this is the first thread, you can pick any theme, but in the future, 4 themes will be posted per thread and posters will be expected to pick one of them. <br><br>

				Today's themes are:<br>
				> Accident <br>
				> Hole <br>
				> Losing Control <br>
				> Hunger <br><br>

				Although 4-koma are mostly gag comic strips, feel free to test waters and try different genres. <br><br>

				If successful, this and every following thread will be archived. If you wish to link your socials for the archive, feel free to do so. <br><br>

				===<br><br>

				>What's the goal? <br>
				Initially my goal here is to consistently provide a simple looking exercise to myself and other anons who aren't feeling very motivated. I strongly believe it's better to produce something simple rather than nothing, and 4-koma's format allows for a lot of experimentation. <br><br>

				In the future, I hope to experiment with other formats beyond 4-koma and maybe even organize an internal /ic/ contest, but it will of course depend on how these threads perform.<br><br>

				===<br><br>

				>What is a 4-koma?<br>
				It is a comic strip of four panels of equal size which normally uses the following format: Context / Goal / Conflict / Resolution.
